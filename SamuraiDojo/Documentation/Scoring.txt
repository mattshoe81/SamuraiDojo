Rules for scoring:

	1. You will be scored weekly by how many test cases you pass.
	2. You will not be penalized for failed tests, but you won't get points for them.
		- This means you can get partial credit for a partial solution!
	3. A completely worthless but coveted title of "Most Efficient" or "Most Elegant" can be given by the Sensei as deemed fit.
