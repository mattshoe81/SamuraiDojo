    /// Without using any loops (which excludes Linq), build a string such that its value
    /// is "0, 1, 2, ... , n", where n is the value of the input parameter.
    /// 
    /// Constraints:
    ///     1. n will always be a positive integer (0 is positive)
    ///     2. You cannot use any loops. That means no for, foreach, or while statements
    ///     3. You cannot use Linq, since Linq uses loops
    ///     
    /// Notes:
    ///     1. Memory efficiency will likely be the determining factor in this puzzle   
    ///     1. Time efficiency is likely going to be of little concern
    ///     
    /// Examples:
    ///     n=1 =&gt; "0, 1"
    ///     n=5 =&gt; "0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5"
    ///     n=0 =&gt; "0"
