When you are first setting up the repository, follow these steps:

	1. Go to the SamuraiDojo.Samurai.cs file and add your name.
		- NOTE: this must be your 'first.last' windows login

	2. Highlight the SamuraiDojo.ScoreBoard project and click the Properties tray (probably on the right)
		- Set Windows Authentication to 'Enabled'
		- Set Anonymous Authentication to 'Disabled'

	3. If you cloned the repository in Matt's personal Github account, you have to accept the invite to 
	   collaborate before you can push.
