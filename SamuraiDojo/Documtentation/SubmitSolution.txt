IMPLEMENT:
	1. Branch your solution off master (not develop) with the form solution/week#/name
	2. Locate the current week's folder in SamuraiDojo/Challenges/{Week#}
	3. Create a class in that folder and implement the provided interface
	4. Go to the SamuraiDojo.Test project and find the current week.
	5. Extend the base test for that week
	6. IMPORTANT! - Decorate ALL of your classes (including tests) with the [WrittenBy(Samurai.YOU)] attribute or you won't get credit.

SUBMIT:
	1. Open a pull request from your branch (should be named solution/week#/name) into master and request the week's Sensei for approval.
	2. DON'T MERGE. The sensei will merge upon the deadline.

That's it!
