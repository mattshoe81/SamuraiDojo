To run benchmarking:
	- Set SamuraiDojo.Benchmarking as your startup project
	- Switch to release mode 
	- Use Debug -> Start Without Debuggin
		- You wont get accurate results if you start with debugging in release mode
	- When the console appears, just select the battle you wish to benchmark
		- This will load up all of the test classes for that battle and run each of 
		  them through the benchmarking tool.
	- This will take some time, but you should see a nice printout of the ranking of efficiency
