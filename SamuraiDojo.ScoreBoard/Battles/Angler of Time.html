How do you calculate the exact angle between the hour hand and minute hand of an analog clock
if you are given 2 integers: hour and minute?
    HINTS:
    •	You do not need any trigonometry or complicated math. Can be done with simple arithmetic (division/subtraction/addition)
    •	Although I’d be pretty impressed if you actually use trig…..
    •	1 clock = 360°
